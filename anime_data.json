Soon, she begins to intermittently switch bodies with Taki Tachibana, a boy from Tokyo. On certain days, Taki and Mitsuha wake up in each other's bodies and must live the entire day as the other, reverting when they go to sleep at night. The two set up ground rules for sharing their bodies, communicating via messages on paper, their phones, and their skin. Mitsuha (in Taki's body) sets Taki up on a date with his coworker, Miki Okudera, while Taki (in Mitsuha's body) helps Mitsuha become more popular at school. While in Mitsuha's body, Taki accompanies Mitsuha's grandmother Hitoha and younger sister Yotsuha to the Shinto shrine on a mountain near Itomori, leaving an offering of kuchikamizake made with Mitsuha's saliva. Hitoha explains that God is the ruler over both time and the connections between humans. Mitsuha tells Taki that the comet Tiamat is expected to pass nearest to Earth on the day of the autumn festival. The next day, Taki goes on a date with Miki in his own body; Miki enjoys the date but says she can tell Taki is preoccupied with someone else. Realizing he is falling for Mitsuha, Taki attempts to call her on the phone but cannot reach her. The body-switching stops as inexplicably as it started. ",

On her way to school one morning, Suzume meets a young man searching for abandoned locations with doors. She tells him of a nearby abandoned onsen resort, and curiously follows him. There, she discovers a door free-standing on its frame. Suzume opens it to see a starlit field through the doorway, which she cannot enter. She then trips over a cat statue on the floor, which turns into a real cat and flees. Frightened, Suzume rushes to school.\r\n\r\nDuring lunch, Suzume notices a huge column of smoke from the location of the abandoned resort, which no one else can see. She returns there and finds the man from earlier, struggling to close the door through which the smoke is escaping. Suzume helps him, and he locks the door with an old key. The worm-like smoke disappears, but not before causing earthquake damage to the town.",

Hodaka struggles to find work in the city. He finds an abandoned Makarov PM handgun and keeps it even though guns are illegal. He meets Hina Amano, a McDonald&#039;s employee, who pities him and gives him free food. Suga hires him as his assistant; he and his niece publish a small occult magazine investigating strange phenomena, including the unusually rainy weather. They hear the legend of &quot;sunshine girls&quot; who can stop rain, and bring sunshine. Hodaka sees Hina being intimidated into working at a club and in panic, fires his gun at the club owner, barely missing him. Frightened, he throws the gun aside. Hina takes him to Yoyogi Kaikan, an abandoned building with a shrine on the roof, and amazes him by demonstrating her ability to clear the sky by praying. Hodaka learns that Hina is an orphan living alone with her younger brother Nagi. Seeing that they&#039;re also in financial trouble, Hodaka proposes they start a business having Hina clear the weather for social gatherings. Their business becomes a success, but Hina is filmed and shown on television, leading to their site getting flooded with requests. They decide to temporarily suspend business to let Hina rest. Meanwhile, Suga and Natsumi interview the old priest of a shrine who tells them the legend of &quot;Weather Maidens&quot; who can control the rain, adding that they pay a heavy price for their powers.",

The arrow is magically imbued with true aim after it is fletched with the heron&amp;amp;#039;s feather. Mahito&amp;amp;#039;s reading of a book left by Hisako is interrupted when an ill Natsuko disappears into the forest. Leading one of the estate&amp;amp;#039;s elderly maids, Kiriko, into the tower, Mahito is deceived by a watery imitation of his mother made by the heron, which dissolves at his touch. Affronted, he pierces the heron&amp;amp;#039;s beak with his arrow, revealing a flightless creature, the Birdman, living inside it. A wizard appears, ordering the Birdman to guide Mahito and Kiriko as all three sink into the floor.",

While she and her siblings are on an outing with their father in his four-flippered submarine, Brunhilde sneaks off and floats away on the back of a jellyfish. After an encounter with a fishing trawler, she becomes trapped in a glass jar and drifts to the shore of a small fishing town where she is rescued by a five-year-old boy named Sōsuke. While shattering the jar with a rock, Sōsuke cuts his finger. Brunhilde licks his blood, healing the wound almost instantly. Sōsuke names her Ponyo and promises to protect her. Meanwhile, a distraught Fujimoto searches frantically for his lost daughter whom he believes to have been kidnapped. He calls his wave spirits to recover her, leaving Sōsuke heartbroken and confused by what happened. This causes a major typhoon-like storm across southern Japan.",
